        <p>At least one unique author must register for RTCSA'25 at the full registration rate (i.e., non-student) for the full/short conference paper to appear in the proceedings. To encourage poster/demo presentations, a full registration can cover a full/short conference paper and a demo/poster abstract. For student demo/poster presenter without a conference paper, a student registration can cover a demo/poster abstract. To elaborate:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A non-student registration covers one conference paper (either full or short) and/or one poster/demo abstract. For this case, please specify the conference paper ID in the registration system and email the poster/demo abstract ID and title to the Registration Chair Duc Van Le at levanduc@ieee.org.</li>
            <li>A student registration covers one poster/demo abstract authored by the student registrant.</li>
            <li>A registration cannot cover a conference paper and/or an extended abstract that aren't/isn't authored by the registrant.</li>
        </ul>
