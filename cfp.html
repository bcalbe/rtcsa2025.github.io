            <p>The RTCSA conference (now in its 31st edition) serves as a pivotal platform for experts from both academia and industry, fostering advancements in <strong>technology</strong> and <strong>theory</strong> for <strong>time-sensitive</strong> applications. The conference's scope encompasses all applications where temporal aspects need to be considered. <strong>Cyber-physical Systems (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), embedded systems, fog/edge/cloud computing</strong> are just notable examples. RTCSA is especially open to new and emerging topics such as the application of machine learning in designing and analyzing embedded and real-time systems, strategies for achieving real-time machine learning, resource management in autonomous systems, and more. RTCSA welcomes both research and industrial papers that describe research or technical aspects in the area of embedded and real-time systems. <strong>Selected papers will be invited to submit an extended version to the Springer <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/11241">Real-Time Systems</a> journal.</strong></p>
            <p>Submission of a paper should be regarded as a commitment that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will register and attend the conference to present the work in person. RTCSA 2025 reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from the digital library and indexing services), if the paper is not presented at the conference.</p>

Conference content will be published by the IEEE Computer Society on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/">IEEExplore</a> and will be indexed by most search engines including <a href="https://www.scopus.com/">Scopus</a>, <a href="https://www.webofknowledge.com/">Web of Science</a>, <a href="https://dblp.uni-trier.de/">DBLP</a>.</p> -->
            <p>In some cases, the Program Committee may decide to accept a full paper submission as a short paper, in which case, the authors will be required to reduce its length for the final version. Accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore, subject to meeting IEEE Xplore's scope and quality requirements.</p>
            <p>Submission site will be up soon. Please check the following web page later for detailed submission instructions: <a hrer=https://rtcsa2025.github.io/?page=submissions.html>submission</a> </p>
            <p>By submitting a paper, authors implicitly agree that at least one author will register at full registration rate to the conference and present the paper in person.</p>
