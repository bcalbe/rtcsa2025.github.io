            <p>At least one unique author must register for RTCSA'25 at the full registration rate (i.e., non-student) for the full/short conference paper to appear in the proceedings. To encourage poster/demo presentations, a full registration can cover a full/short conference paper and a demo/poster abstract. For student demo/poster presenter without a conference paper, a student registration can cover a demo/poster abstract. To elaborate:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A non-student registration covers one conference paper (either full or short) and/or one poster/demo abstract. For this case, please specify the conference paper ID in the registration system and email the poster/demo abstract ID and title to the Registration Chair Duc Van Le at levanduc@ieee.org.</li>
                <li>A student registration covers one poster/demo abstract authored by the student registrant.</li>
                <li>A registration cannot cover a conference paper and/or an extended abstract that aren't/isn't authored by the registrant.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>Notes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each accepted contribution needs to meet the requirement by July 18th 2025. Otherwise, the contribution may be excluded from the conference program and proceedings.</li>
                <li>Wire transfer payment should be sent 2-3 weeks prior to the deadline of July 18th 2025 to allow sufficient time for the conference to receive payment. </li>
                <li>Author registrations to meet the above requirement are non-refundable. </li>
                <li>Life member rates are applicable to an IEEE Member whose membership status is “Life”.</li>
                <li>RTCSA'25 only accepts in-person presentations. Overseas presenting authors, invited speakers, and panelists should plan the travels and entry visas accordingly. We will allow replacement in-person paper/poster/demo presenters or virtual paper presentations only in case of visa issues, illness, or other genuine hardship and with prior permission of the General Co-Chairs based on documentary proofs. Papers and extended abstracts without presentations will be removed from the conference proceedings.</li>
