                    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                    <p>The conventional wisdom of wireless networking tells us that concurrent transmissions on the same channel from multiple senders colliding at a receiver result in packet loss. However, this is not always true: when transmissions are tightly synchronized, and given power conditions hold, one of the colliding transmissions is nearly always received due to the capture effect. In this talk, we explore the opportunities enabled by this technique in ultra-wideband (UWB) radios, thanks to their unique characteristics. On one hand, concurrent transmissions can be exploited for multi-hop communication, enabling novel network primitives and protocol designs with unprecedented performance and reliability, including network-wide time synchronization with an error of less than 30ns. On the other hand, they can be exploited in conjunction with the distinctive features of UWB: distance estimation and localization. Indeed, UWB transmissions rely on very short pulses; their individual times of arrival can be discriminated in the channel impulse response (CIR) at the receiver. However, the ns-level resolution required for localization poses significant challenges in accurately extracting time information. We report our experience in designing unconventional schemes where a device can simultaneously estimate its distance from several others, or a set of devices can localize countless targets in an area, yielding accuracy comparable to conventional schemes but significantly faster and more energy-efficient operation.</p>

                    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                    <p>Robotic systems are inherently complex, comprising spatial elements such as mechanical structures, mechanisms, and mechatronic assemblies, as well as temporal computational processes including perception, decision-making, and actuation. Achieving versatile and agile behaviors in robotic platforms to meet the demands of diverse operational scenarios necessitates a holistic and well-orchestrated approach to design and integration. This keynote will present recent developments in robotic systems, with a particular emphasis on legged and leg-wheel hybrid locomotion platforms.</p>
                    <p>Drawing inspiration from the dynamic mobility of legged animals, which exhibit remarkable adaptability to unstructured and uneven terrains, this work explores the biomechanical and control principles that inform the design and locomotion strategies of legged robots. In contrast, wheeled locomotion offers advantages in smoothness and energy efficiency, representing one of the most enduring and effective forms of engineered mobility. By integrating these complementary modalities, leg-wheel hybrid robots offer a promising synthesis of adaptability and efficiency.</p>
                    <p>The presentation will address both the design methodologies and control frameworks essential for realizing such multi-modal robotic systems. Emphasis will be placed on system-level integration techniques that enable seamless coordination of mechanical and computational subsystems to achieve robust, agile, and task-flexible robotic behavior.</p>

                    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                    <p>Over the past decades, real-time embedded systems have evolved from simple micro-controllers to foundational technologies forming the invisible backbone of our modern world. They now span applications from industrial automation to everyday consumer electronics. Pioneering breakthroughs such as real-time scheduling, WCET analysis, model-based co-design, and formally verified kernels have enabled the seamless integration of physical and cyber domains. Asia, in particular, has emerged as a major centre of academic excellence, technological innovation, and large-scale deployment, exemplified by Singapore's ambitious Smart Nation initiative.</p>
                    <p>Today, we stand at the cusp of another transformation: embodied intelligence, powered by on-device AI. Embedded systems research has consistently anticipated such frontiers, driving innovations that reshape broader technological trends. This emerging paradigm imposes stringent constraints in latency, real-time responsiveness, ultra-low power consumption, and robust safety and security guarantees. Our community is not only well-positioned to meet these demands but to define the next era of intelligent systems. In this talk, I will reflect on the key milestones that brought us to this point and frame the research directions necessary to realize the promise of embodied intelligence.</p>
