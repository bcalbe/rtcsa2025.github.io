            <h2>RTCSA'25 Call for Tutorial Proposals</h2>
            <p>The 31st IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications (RTCSA'25) will be held in Singapore from August 20th to 22nd, 2025. 
                We are calling for proposals for tutorials on the morning of August 20th (i.e., before the main conference starting in the afternoon of August 20th). Interested proposers shall send the proposals via email to the General Co-Chairs Rui Tan <tanrui@ntu.edu.sg> and Xue Liu <xueliu@cs.mcgill.ca> by July 7th 2025 AoE. Accepted proposal(s) will be notified by July 11th 2025. 
                The proposal shall include the following information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Organizers and roles (e.g., Chair, Tutor, etc)</li>
                <li>Short bio of each organizer</li>
                <li>Title and abstract of the tutorial</li>
                <li>Choice of tutorial duration from the options of 2 hours and 4 hours</li>
                <li>The estimated number of attendees</li>
                <li>Supporting information/documents (if any), e.g., URL to an existing draft slides deck for the tutorial or video of a prior run of the tutorial</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3>Notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Each organizer is required to register for the conference.</li>
                <li>The tutorials will be the value-adds for the conference attendees, say, there will be no separate registration item for the tutorials. Only conference registrants can attend the tutorials.</li>
                <li>Tutors who hold a PhD degree and are currently serving in research units (e.g., university, industrial research lab, etc) are preferred. The tutors are volunteers and not paid by the conference.</li>
                <li>The tutorial cannot contain any materials for commercial purposes. Tutors from the commercial sector (e.g., industrial research labs) should declare that the tutorial content will be neutralized to contain no information about any specific commercial products/services.</li>
                <li>For accepted tutorials, the conference organizers will poll the actual interests of the conference attendees by sending them a Google form containing information about the accepted tutorials. The poll will run from July 19th (i.e., after the early registration deadline) to July 30th. After that, the conference organizers will reserve tutorial rooms of the right size. A tutorial with fewer than 5 indicated interests (excluding the tutorial organizers) will be canceled due to the disproportionate cost incurred to the conference otherwise.</li>
                <li>Light beverages may be provided if the conference budget allows.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p></p>
