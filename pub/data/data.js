In this work, we focus on enabling anytime computing for deep neural networks (DNNs) that process LiDAR point clouds for 3D object detection. We propose a novel method that enables multi-resolution inference, allowing the input to be dynamically scaled and processed at the resolution needed to meet timing requirements. Importantly, our memory-efficient approach requires the deployment of only a single DNN model, avoiding the need to deploy multiple models, each trained for a different input resolution. We also introduce a deadline-aware scheduler that selects the highest possible resolution for any given input by accurately predicting the execution time for all possible resolutions at runtime, which is a challenging task due to the irregularity of LiDAR point clouds. Experimental results on the nuScenes autonomous driving dataset demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing anytime computing approaches for LiDAR object detection.

							"abstract": "Cyber-physical systems are getting increasingly connected to cellular and wireless networks. As a prominent example, the automotive industry has witnessed a rapid increase in embedded software and electronics, and lately also increased connectivity to cellular communication networks. This trend enables the deployment of applications on network edge computers, offering opportunities for reduced embedded hardware footprint and increased expandability of new applications. Put differently, the traditional automotive platform comprising embedded networked processors expands to the cellular network and edge computing services in its environment. For real-time applications, which are very common in the automotive domain, the aforementioned trend gives rise to completely new challenges in that mobility and the underlying cellular network impact the temporal properties and the design and implementation decisions of the application.

As a prominent example, the automotive industry has witnessed a rapid increase in embedded software and electronics, and lately also increased connectivity to cellular communication networks. This trend enables the deployment of applications on network edge computers, offering opportunities for reduced embedded hardware footprint and increased expandability of new applications. Put differently, the traditional automotive platform comprising embedded networked processors expands to the cellular network and edge computing services in its environment. For real-time applications, which are very common in the automotive domain, the aforementioned trend gives rise to completely new challenges in that mobility and the underlying cellular network impact the temporal properties and the design and implementation decisions of the application.

Since the applications are typically highly modularized, publish\u2013subscribe (pub/sub) pattern is widely used to deliver data among components. However, existing pub/sub middleware introduces significant latency due to redundant memory copies between GPU and host memory. To address this, we propose GPU-Aware Pub/Sub communication (GAPS), a universal solution that integrates shared CUDA memory with existing pub/sub middleware, such as Zenoh-pico and Iceoryx. GAPS minimizes data transfer latency by enabling GPU memory sharing between publishers and subscribers, eliminating unnecessary memory copies. In our work, we propose an independent shared CUDA memory manager that creates a shared CUDA memory pool for each topic during a topic's initialization. For fine-grained allocation from the pool, we modify Two-Level Segregated Fit (TLSF), a real-time dynamic memory allocator, making it process-safe and capable of managing GPU memory.

							"abstract": "Ethernet communication technology is growing in deployments across many real-time embedded systems. Through the IEEE 802.1 standardization group, Ethernet has been enhanced with several protocols and traffic scheduling policies, commonly known as Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). Time-triggered communication is a common approach in TSN, but unfortunately not able to meet timing constraints for applications with very stringent real-time requirements. Past work has addressed this issue by combining time-aware scheduling with frame preemption, another key TSN standard.

Through the IEEE 802.1 standardization group, Ethernet has been enhanced with several protocols and traffic scheduling policies, commonly known as Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). Time-triggered communication is a common approach in TSN, but unfortunately not able to meet timing constraints for applications with very stringent real-time requirements. Past work has addressed this issue by combining time-aware scheduling with frame preemption, another key TSN standard. While frame preemption enhances schedulability, it comes with additional hardware cost for endpoints and switches. To reconcile the requirements of low-cost, real-time applications, this paper addresses the joint problem of minimizing hardware preemption cost and scheduling real-time communications across packet-switched Ethernet networks.

Moreover, battery degradation is affected by environmental factors such as ambient temperature and charging current, making it difficult to predict. To reduce both power usage and embodied carbon emissions, we propose LCAD, a low-carbon autonomous driving computing system via adaptive solar battery systems. LCAD harvests solar energy to reduce carbon emissions from fossil power usage.

Accurate real-time prediction of solver runtime has become more important for optimal solver selection and efficient resource allocation, especially as solvers and hardware advance. In this work, we evaluate the performance of major machine learning models on SAT runtime prediction tasks, using recent SAT competition datasets. Furthermore, we use not only conventional evaluation metrics e.g., Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), but also more detailed metrics e.g., classification-based confusion matrices and cumulative error distributions. Consequently, we observe that the performance of random forest models, often showing the highest performance in previous studies, is poor and biased toward the median runtime, while the performance of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models is more robust even when their RMSE and MAE are higher. These results offer new insights not only for developing more reliable runtime prediction models but also for improving algorithm selection and resource management methods in SAT solving.",

Consequently, we observe that the performance of random forest models, often showing the highest performance in previous studies, is poor and biased toward the median runtime, while the performance of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models is more robust even when their RMSE and MAE are higher. These results offer new insights not only for developing more reliable runtime prediction models but also for improving algorithm selection and resource management methods in SAT solving.",
